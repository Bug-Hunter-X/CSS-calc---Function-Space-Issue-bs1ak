The problem lies in the missing spaces around the minus operator in the `calc()` function.  Here's how to fix it:

Incorrect:
```css
width:calc(100%-10px);
```

Correct:
```css
width: calc(100% - 10px);
```
By adding spaces around the `-` operator, the `calc()` function correctly evaluates the expression.
